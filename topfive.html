                <h2>Queen of Tears (2024)</h2>
                <p>This is one of the most anticipated drama by KDrama lovers because of the lead actors and actresses. Why?
                    Kim Soohyun is Korea's highest paid actor and Kim Jiwon is most talked actress in Korea right now because
                    of her multiple hit dramas. Along with the title that seemed to make the audiences curious and lines of
                    successful actors, after the first episode of Queen of Tears, many has fallen in love. I am not the exception.
                    This drama talks about a struggling married couple, Baek Hyunwoo (Kim Soohyun), the son of a farmer and Hong Haein (Kim Jiwon), 
                    the daughter of a department store owner. This marriage couple
                    struggles against the differences between their families, enemies, trust and betrayal, while trying to find their way back to each other.
                    I like how this drama, despite the differences they both have, still love each other very much. To be honest, this drama deserves the awards that
                    they have been nominated bc of the raw emotions each actor and actresses have potrayed.

                <h2>Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo (2016)</h2>
                <p>This drama is one of the dramas that I haven't fully moved on yet. This 2016 kdrama is full of life, love and death.
                    Scarlet Heart is a remake of a Chinese drama with the same title. This drama first started with a woman in her
                    mid 20s named Ha Jin (IU), jumping into a lake to save a drowning young boy, but found herself transported to the Goryeo Dynasty, where she became
                    a woman's body named Haesoo. From that day on, Hajin lived as Haesoo. She then found herself involved with the royals from
                    that dynasty, where she has fallen in love with the third prince, Wang So (Lee Joon Gi). From the first episode,
                    I have fallen in love with this drama. Besides, the actors and actresses are incredible too. However, as this drama unfolds itselves,
                    I found myself getting nervous whose death im going to witness. It was depressing, seeing the power struggle between the princes and the obstacles Haesoo and Wangso
                    have to face, individually and together.
                    It was so tragically beautiful, that I am still holding
                    on to the hope that the director would make a season two of this drama, even after so many years. But unfortunately, it might never happen,
                    since this drama is not popular in Korea. Their popularity internationally isn't enough to convince the director even if the actors have voiced out their
                    wish for season two of Scarlet Heart. I was 13 then, and I'm 21 now.
                    I wish I could watch this drama for the first time again, without knowing what would happen. Even so, this drama
                    is easily one of my favourite dramas that I have ever watched. I remember sobbing on a few of the characters' death.

                <h2>Scent of A Woman (2011)</h2>
                <p>A story about a tired woman in corporate industry, named Lee Yeon Jae (Lee Sun Ah), and the newly appointed CEO of her workplace.
                    Yeon Jae is tired of working for 10 years in the company that hasn't been appreciative towards her dedication, especially her boss.
                    Moreover, after finding out she has cancer, she decides that it's enough mistreatment, and with an interesting exit from her company,
                    she travels to Japan as a reward for herself. But some misunderstanding happens, and she ends up as the Japanese translator
                    for her CEO! The plot of this drama is nothing ordinary, and most of the Kdramas are always the rich man falling for the ppor girl.
                    The trope is exactly like that, but that is not the reason why I like this drama. It's the storyline, the perfect balance of humor and pain,
                    and the way these two are pulling and pushing each other, finding ways to stay together. And this drama is also the reason that I like the male lead,
                    Lee Dong Wook. Even after so many years, he is still the excellent actor that he is. Also, this drama has the same title as the movie
                    starring El Pacino, 'The Scent of A Woman', and in this drama, lee Yeon Jae is taking tango classes, and there is one point
                    when the CEO named Kang Ji Wook (Lee Dong Wook) even takes tango classes, just because he couldnt forget about her. I still remember
                    the first time they were partnered in that tango class!

                <h2>The Heirs (2013)</h2>
                <p>I dont remember the amount of times I have seen this drama, actually. And every rewatch is so fun, and i dont get bored.
                    Each character in this drama is so interesting, funny, and they have their own issues. This drama is starred by Lee Minho and Park Shin Hye as the leads.
                    This story follows a rich chaebol, Kim Tan played by Lee Minho, and the daughter of a maid working at the house of Kim Tan's family, Cha Eun Sang, played by Park SHin Hye.
                    In the first episode, Kim Tan can be seen surfing in California, US while CHa Eunsang has just landed in California to visit her sister, who is getting married
                    with her white lover. But unfortunately, things didn't go according to her way and somehow, she is mistaken to be a drug dealer. Eunsang is in distress since her English is limited and there
                    Kim Tan decides to help her since he is fluent in English. From there, they get to know each other, and Kim Tan even brings her along to his college! 
                    But, things only get worst from there. Kim Tan's fiance, his and her famiy problem, the bully, and especially Kim Tan's brother who is threatened by the fact that 
                    his inheritance to the company will be given to Tan. This drama is a roller-coaster of emotions, but honestly, I like it a lot.
                    This drama also has a line of actors and actresses that are well known in Korea such as Kim Woobin, Kim Jiwon, Kang Ha Neul, Krystal and Park Hyung Sook. Surprisingly, the writer of The Heirs is actually
                    the same writer of Secret Garden!

                <h2>Secret Garden (2010)</h2>
                <p>Can I just tell you this is the reason why I love watching KDrama? Because it is! Secret Garden is a drama about a high-end CEO
                    of a department store, Kim Joo Won (Hyun Bin), falls head over heels to a down-to-earth stuntwoman, Gil Ra Im (Ha Ji Won). This drama stats with
                    Joo Won's cousin, Oska, a famous South Korean singer, telling him to stop the actress that threatens her to leak
                    their pictures together. Joo Won, reluctantly, finds the actress but he mistakenly brings the wrong woman to meet Oska! And guess who? 
                    Gil Ra Im! At that time, Gil Ra Im is acting, doing her stunt work as a stunt double for the actress Joo Won is looking for.
                    The two of them dont have a friendly encounter and Gil Ra Im is not friendly with the spoiled Joo Won either. However, unfortunately for her, Joo Won finds himself smitten,
                    and he falls more and more after meeting Gil Ra Im. She has passion for her job, and she isn't afraid to challenge herself,
                    and just that, Joo Won falls in love with her coolness. Gil Ra IM keeps pushing Joo Won away, even when Joo Won keeps chasing her, and acting
                    differently from his usual self, to go out of his way to make Gil Ra Im falls for him. The more they spend the time together, the more Joo WOn learns about the poor living of
                    Gil Ra Im, and Gil Ra Im learns more about Joo Won's rich way of living. This drama is a classic, and it is a drama every Kdrama watcher should watch.
